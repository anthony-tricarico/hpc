/* We've implicitly assumed that each call to Compure_next_value requires roughly the same amount of 
 * work as the other calls. How would you change your answer to the preceding question if call i = k
 * requires k + 1 times as much work as the call with i = 0? So if the first call (i = 0) requires 2
 * milliseconds, the second call (i = 1) requires 4, the third (i = 2) requires 6, and so on. */
